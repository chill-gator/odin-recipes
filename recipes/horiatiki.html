    <ul>
        <li>5 large tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>sea salt TT</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) slice feta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>1 small green bell pepper, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Greek black olives</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut your tomatoes into wedges over the bowl that you're secing the salad in, so that any extra juices land in the bowl. Add onion slices. Liberally season with salt and oregano. Mix and allow tomatoes to sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes, up to 2 hours, so that the salt releases the tomatoes' juices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the cucumber, bell pepper, and olives just before serving. Top with feta cheese and drizzle with olive oil.
